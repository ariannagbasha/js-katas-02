# Assessment: JavaScript Katas 2

### Overview ###

A [kata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kata_(programming)) is an individual exercise where you practice a programming skill through repetition. Today you will practice using JavaScript loops, conditionals, and expressions through a series of katas.The functions start out trivial and ramp up in difficulty. The main goals of these katas are:
* get you used to writing and calling functions that take arguments and return results
* get you used to breaking down a problem into the various parts of a for loop
You will use the [return](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/return) keyword for the output of your function. Unlike other katas we've done up until now, most of these build on each other, which means that **you'll need to complete them in order.**

When giving constraints for the implementation, note that anything I say about functions also applies to methods (we'll talk about the difference soon).

### Add(1 point) ###

Write a function named "add" that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

You may use built-in operators to finish the definition.

For example, calling *add*(2, 4) should return a result of 6.

### Multiply(2 point) ###

Write a function named "multiply" that takes two arguments and returns their product.

You **may not** use built-in arithmetic operators or functions (like the * built-in operator for multiplication). Instead, you'll need a for loop which calls the "add" function you wrote earlier.

For example, calling *multiply*(6, 8) should return a result of 48.
